```

2. Set up a VPS

- Install docker and docker-compose

3. Set up DNS records

Use Cloudflare for automatic SSL. Set SSL mode to Flexible.

If your `HOST` is set to `proximity.example.com`: 

1. An `A` record on `backend-proximity.example.com` pointing to your server's IP
2. An `A` record on `proximity.example.com` pointing to your server's IP
3. An `A` record on `turn-proximity.example.com` pointing to your server's IP **NOT PROXIED THROUGH CLOUDFLARE**
4. An `AAAA` record on `turn-proximity.example.com` pointing to your server's IPv6 **NOT PROXIED THROUGH CLOUDFLARE**
